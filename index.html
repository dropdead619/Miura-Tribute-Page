        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p>
           &ensp; Kentaro Miura (三浦 建太郎, Miura Kentarō) (July 11, 1966 – May 6,
          2021) was a Japanese manga artist. He was best known for his acclaimed
          dark fantasy manga Berserk, which began serialization in 1989 and
          continued until his death. As of 2021, Berserk had more than 50
          million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga
          series of all time. In 2002, Miura received the Tezuka Osamu Cultural
          Prize.

           &ensp; Miura was born on July 11, 1966, in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. In
          1976, at the age of 10, he created his first manga, entitled
          Miuranger, which was published for his classmates in a school
          publication; the series ended up spanning 40 volumes. In 1977, Miura
          created his second manga, Ken e no Michi (剣への道, "The Way to the
          Sword"), in which he used India ink for the first time. When he was in
          middle school in 1979, his drawing techniques improved greatly as he
          started using professional drawing techniques. While in high school in
          1982, Miura enrolled in an artistic curriculum, where he and his
          classmates started publishing their works in school booklets. His
          first doujinshi was published in a magazine with the help of friends,
          in the same year. At age 18, Miura briefly worked as an assistant to
          George Morikawa, of Hajime no Ippo fame. Morikawa quickly acknowledged
          Miura's high artistic level and dismissed him, saying there was
          nothing he could teach that Miura did not already know.
